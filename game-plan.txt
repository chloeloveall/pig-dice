Roll a single die
Die value is added to a div to display
If additional roll occurs, die value is added to previous die value
When player selects to 'hold' the running total from turn is added to score total
if player 'rolls' a 1, all points from turn are forfeited 
When score total reaches or exceeds 100, game is over and winner is declared
